# om-autocomplete

An autocomplete component for [Om](http://github.com/swannodette/om).

## Examples

* [Bootstrap](http://arosequist.github.io/om-autocomplete/bootstrap/index.html) ([source](https://github.com/arosequist/om-autocomplete/blob/master/examples/bootstrap/src/arosequist/om_autocomplete/examples/bootstrap.cljs)) demonstrates basic usage of the built-in Twitter Bootstrap components. The suggestions recommended are just variants of the input text.

* [Movies](http://arosequist.github.io/om-autocomplete/movies/index.html) ([source](https://github.com/arosequist/om-autocomplete/blob/master/examples/movies/src/arosequist/om_autocomplete/examples/movies.cljs)) uses a remote webservice to fetch suggestions. _The service is down, so this demo doesn't currently work. Will update when I can replace it with another one._

## Components

Here's a mockup of a basic autocompleter:

</p>

The `arosequist.om-autocomplete` namespace contains a single function, `autocomplete`, which is an Om component that handles the core autocomplete logic, but does not directly render any DOM elements. Instead, you give it three main components:

1. The **container view** just holds the other two components. Typically, this will render a simple wrapper div.
1. The **input view** is responsible for taking user input.
1. The **results view** displays the suggestions that were generated based on the input.

Some important terms are:

* The input has **focus** that is either true or false, normally corresponding to the normal HTML focus. You'll often want to hide the results when the input loses focus.
* The input also has a **value** ("uni" in the example). When this changes, the list of suggestions will be refreshed.
* A **suggestion** can be anything. Your results view just needs to know how to display it. In the example, each suggestion contains the flag and country name.
* The **highlighted** suggestion is usually changed by hovering the mouse or pressing the up/down arrow keys. Here, "United States" is the highlighted suggestion.
* A suggestion can be **selected**, typically by clicking the mouse or pressing enter. This usually signals the end of the autocomplete workflow.

## Details

The options for `autocomplete` are (as keywords):

* **result-ch**: a channel that will receive an item once it's been selected.
* **suggestions-fn**: a function that calculates the suggestions for a given input. It takes three arguments: the input value, a channel to place the suggestions (as a single seq), and a channel that, when closed, indicates that the input changed and you should cancel fetching suggestions (when applicable).
* **container-view**: an Om component that will hold `input-component` and `results-component`.
* **container-opts**: any options that should be passed to the `container-view`.
* **input-view**: an Om component that will be responsible for taking user input. The state it receives will contain:
 * **focus-ch**: a channel that you should put `true` on whenever the input receives focus, and `false` when the input loses focus.
 * **value-ch**: a channel that you should put the user-supplied value onto when it changes.
 * **highlight-ch**: a channel that you should put the index of the highlighted item onto when it changes.
 * **select-ch**: a channel that you should put the index of an item onto when it's selected.
 * **value**: the current user-entered value.
 * **highlighted-index**: the index of the suggestion that's currently highlighted.
* **input-view-opts**: any options that should be passed to the `input-view`.
* **results-view**: an Om component that will be responsible for displaying autocompleted results. The state it receives will contain:
 * **highlight-ch**: a channel that you should put the index of an item onto when it's highlighted.
 * **select-ch**: a channel that you should put the index of an item onto when it's selected.
 * **value**: the current user-entered value.
 * **loading?**: a boolean that indicates if the suggestions are currently being loaded.
 * **focused?**: a boolean that indicates if the input is currently focused.
 * **suggestions**: the suggestions, as provided by the `suggestions-fn`.
 * **highlighted-index**: the index of the suggestion that's currently highlighted.
* **results-view-opts**: any options that should be passed to the `results-view`.

## Bootstrap

om-autocomplete contains some convenience functions for pages that are using Twitter Boostrap. They are located in the `arosequist.om-autocomplete.bootstrap` namespace. *TODO: More documentation here*

Much of the code in this namespace isn't Bootstrap-specific, and I expect to create other helper namespaces for common use cases.
